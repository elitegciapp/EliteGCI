## [SECTION 1: THE CALCULATOR - 0:20-2:30]
**On Screen:** Navigate to Calculator tab

"Let's start with the heart of EliteGCI - the Calculator page. This is where you'll calculate your take-home commission for any deal."

### Commission Breakdown Section
**On Screen:** Point to Commission Breakdown card on the left

"At the very top of the Commission Breakdown, you'll see the most important number prominently displayed - your After-Tax Take-Home. This is calculated by taking your commission, subtracting all splits and fees, and then subtracting the estimated tax."

"Below that, you'll see the complete breakdown: Total Commission from the sale, the Brokerage Portion, Your Portion Before Tax (this is your GCI after splits and fees), and the Estimated Tax amount. At the bottom, you can see your commission rate and split percentage for reference."

"And here's a key feature - at the bottom of this card is a Save Entry button. When you click this, it saves all the details of this deal to your GCI Trends for tracking over time."

### Transaction Details
**On Screen:** Scroll to Transaction Details form

"Now, let's fill in the details of your deal. Simply enter:
- The sale price of the property
- The commission rate you're earning
- Your split percentage with your brokerage
- Any transaction fees like coordinator fees, brokerage fees, or referral fees
- And your estimated tax rate"

**On Screen:** Fill in sample data (500,000 sale price, 2.5% commission, 70% split)

"As you type, watch the Commission Breakdown update in real-time. Every field you change instantly recalculates your take-home amount."

**On Screen:** Point to Save Entry button in Commission Breakdown card

"When you're happy with the calculation, click the Save Entry button right here in the Commission Breakdown card. This saves the deal to your GCI Trends page where you can track all your commissions over time."

### Quick Fill Options
**On Screen:** Point to Quick Fill Options card

"EliteGCI includes Quick Fill Options for common scenarios. With one click, you can populate typical luxury listings, first-time buyer deals, or investor properties. This saves you time when running multiple scenarios."

### Market Analysis
**On Screen:** Show Market Analysis card

"The Market Analysis section is powerful. It shows you how many deals per year you need to close based on your average commission. And here's the smart part - if you've saved previous deals, it automatically uses YOUR actual average commission, not just estimates."

### Goal Calculators
**On Screen:** Scroll to Annual Income Goal Calculator

"Want to hit a specific income target? The Annual Income Goal Calculator tells you exactly how many deals you need to close. Just enter your desired annual income, your average deal size, and commission rate."

**On Screen:** Show Desired Volume Calculator

"Similarly, the Desired Volume Calculator helps you figure out how many transactions you need to reach a specific sales volume goal."

### Quick Tax Estimate
**On Screen:** Point to Quick Tax Estimate

"The Quick Tax Estimate card gives you another view of your tax liability. Use the slider to adjust your estimated tax rate between 0 and 50%. As you move it, you'll see the exact dollar amount of estimated tax update in real-time."

"This rate also updates the Commission Breakdown above, so you can instantly see how different tax scenarios affect your final take-home amount. This is perfect for testing 'what if' scenarios."

## [SECTION 2: GCI TRENDS - 2:30-4:00]
**On Screen:** Click on GCI Trends tab

- Your average commission per deal
- And your average commission percentage"

"These numbers help you understand your business performance at a glance."

### Month Filter Feature
**On Screen:** Click on the Filter Entries card

"Here's a powerful new feature - the Month Filter. Click this dropdown and you can filter all your entries by specific months."

**On Screen:** Open month dropdown

"Notice how each month shows the exact number of entries? This makes it easy to analyze your performance month by month. When you select a month, all the summary cards update to show only that month's data."

**On Screen:** Select a specific month

"See that? Now we're only seeing data from November 2025, and it says 'Showing 2 of 2 total entries.' All the averages have recalculated for just this month."

**On Screen:** Select "All Months" again

"Switch back to 'All Months' to see everything again."

### Saved Entries Detail
**On Screen:** Scroll to individual entry cards

"Below the summaries, you'll see every deal you've saved, with complete details:
- The date you saved it
- Sale price and commission details
- Your split percentage
- And most importantly, a clear breakdown showing your Pre-Tax Commission, the Estimated Tax amount, and your After-Tax Take-Home"

"This three-tier breakdown makes it crystal clear where your money is going."

## [SECTION 3: TAXES - 4:00-5:30]
**On Screen:** Click on Taxes tab

"Let's move to the Taxes page - this is where EliteGCI really shines for tax planning."

### Automatic Tax Calculation
**On Screen:** Point to Tax Rate Configuration card

"The first thing you'll notice is the Automatic Tax Calculation toggle. When this is on, EliteGCI uses real IRS 2024 tax brackets to calculate your effective tax rate."

**On Screen:** Show Filing Status dropdown

"Select your filing status - Single, Married Filing Jointly, or Head of Household - and the app instantly calculates your effective tax rate based on your total income from all saved deals."

**On Screen:** Point to the calculation details

"It shows three key numbers:
- Your total annual income from all your saved commission deals
- Your effective tax rate - this is the average rate you'll pay across all your income based on IRS brackets
- Your marginal tax bracket - this shows which tax bracket your income falls into"

"These calculations use actual 2024 IRS federal tax brackets for all three filing statuses, so you're getting realistic estimates based on current tax law. The app calculates the progressive tax across all brackets to give you an accurate effective rate."

### Manual Tax Adjustment
**On Screen:** Toggle off the automatic calculation

"If you want to use a specific tax rate, just toggle off the automatic calculation. Now you get a slider and input field where you can set any rate between 0 and 50%."

**On Screen:** Adjust the slider

"As you adjust it, watch all the numbers update in real-time. You can also see what your original average tax rate was from saved entries for reference."

### Tax Summary Cards
**On Screen:** Highlight the three summary cards

"The summary section shows:
- Total taxes owed across all your saved deals
- Your current adjusted tax rate
- And the total number of deals in the system"

### Tax Liability by Deal
**On Screen:** Scroll to individual tax entries

"Finally, you can see the tax liability for each individual deal. This shows the date, sale price, your pre-tax income, after-tax take-home, and most importantly - the tax owed on that specific deal."

"This helps you set aside money for taxes deal-by-deal, so you're never caught off guard come tax season."
